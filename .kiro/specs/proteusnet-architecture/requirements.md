# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ProteusNet is a novel physics-informed transformer architecture designed for hierarchical protein understanding. The system aims to advance the state-of-the-art in protein function prediction, structure prediction, and stability analysis by incorporating physical constraints and multi-scale processing into transformer attention mechanisms. The project focuses on three key innovations: physics-informed attention that incorporates distance and interaction constraints, hierarchical multi-scale processing from amino acid to domain level, and evolutionary pre-training objectives for better representation learning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a protein researcher, I want a physics-informed attention mechanism that incorporates protein physical constraints, so that the model can make more biologically accurate predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN secondary structure information is available THEN the system SHALL incorporate secondary structure bias into attention computation
4. WHEN physics features are provided THEN the system SHALL scale attention based on learnable physics constants
5. IF no physics features are available THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to standard attention without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a computational biologist, I want hierarchical multi-scale processing capabilities, so that the model can capture protein features at amino acid, motif, and domain levels simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing protein sequences THEN the system SHALL encode information at three hierarchical levels: amino acid, motif, and domain

3. WHEN moving between levels THEN the system SHALL implement cross-level attention mechanisms for information integration
4. WHEN downsampling for higher levels THEN the system SHALL use strided convolution pooling strategies
5. WHEN fusing multi-level features THEN the system SHALL align all features to original sequence length and concatenate before fusion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want the core ProteusNet architecture to support multiple prediction tasks, so that I can evaluate the model's versatility across different protein analysis problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model processes input sequences THEN the system SHALL support amino acid embedding, positional embedding, and physics feature projection
2. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL provide separate output heads for function prediction (GO terms), structure prediction (secondary structure), and stability prediction
3. WHEN physics features are available THEN the system SHALL integrate them through dedicated projection layers
4. WHEN evolutionary features are provided THEN the system SHALL incorporate them into the embedding process

**User Story:** As a deep learning practitioner, I want a comprehensive training pipeline with novel loss functions, so that I can train the model with multiple objectives including physics consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training the model THEN the system SHALL support multiple loss functions: function prediction, structure prediction, stability prediction, and physics consistency
2. WHEN computing total loss THEN the system SHALL apply configurable weights to each loss component
3. WHEN physics features are available THEN the system SHALL enforce physics consistency through custom loss functions
4. WHEN training THEN the system SHALL implement gradient clipping and proper optimization with AdamW
5. WHEN logging training progress THEN the system SHALL track and report all individual loss components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher evaluating model performance, I want comprehensive benchmark evaluation capabilities, so that I can compare ProteusNet against state-of-the-art methods on standard protein prediction tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating function prediction THEN the system SHALL compute AUC macro, AUC micro, F1 macro, and F1 micro scores
2. WHEN evaluating structure prediction THEN the system SHALL compute Q8 accuracy for 8-state secondary structure prediction
3. WHEN evaluating stability prediction THEN the system SHALL compute correlation with experimental stability data
4. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL support batch processing of test datasets
5. WHEN generating evaluation reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics for each prediction task

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with the ProteusNet codebase, I want proper configuration management and modular architecture, so that I can easily experiment with different model configurations and training settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the model THEN the system SHALL support YAML-based configuration files for model architecture and training parameters
2. WHEN initializing components THEN the system SHALL support configurable model dimensions, attention heads, layer counts, and hierarchical levels
3. WHEN setting up training THEN the system SHALL support configurable batch sizes, learning rates, loss weights, and physics parameters
4. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL support multiple protein datasets including UniProt, PDB, and GO annotations
5. WHEN preprocessing sequences THEN the system SHALL support configurable sequence length limits and filtering options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher analyzing model behavior, I want interpretability and visualization tools, so that I can understand how the physics-informed attention mechanisms capture biological relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing attention patterns THEN the system SHALL provide visualization tools for attention weights across different heads and layers
2. WHEN examining physics constraints THEN the system SHALL visualize distance bias and interaction matrix learned parameters
3. WHEN studying hierarchical features THEN the system SHALL provide tools to visualize features at different scale levels
4. WHEN interpreting predictions THEN the system SHALL support attention-based explanation of model decisions
5. WHEN generating visualizations THEN the system SHALL support export to common formats for publication and analysis
